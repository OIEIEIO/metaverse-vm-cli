## Quickstart

If you just plan to read from the blockchain, you do not need any ETP and you do not need to set your `MVS_PRIVATE_KEY`. If you plan to deploy contracts or write anything to the blockchain, you'll need ETP and you'll need to set your `MVS_PRIVATE_KEY` for the account that has those tokens.

### Network selection (Optional)
#### a) Connect to a local node (default)

This option is the default. It will try to connect to a local node on http://localhost:9933 which is the default of a locally running fullnode. 
#### b) Use Hyperspace mainnet explorer RPC

Set the environment variable

```sh
# To use the mainnet
export MVS_NETWORK=hyperspace
# OR
export MVS_RPC_URL=https://vm.mvs.org/mainnet_rpc/
```

Or add the parameter --network hyperspace to your mvs-vm-cli command

#### c) Use Hyperspace testnet explorer RPC

```sh
# To use the mainnet
export MVS_NETWORK=testnet
# OR
export MVS_RPC_URL=https://vm.mvs.org/testnet_rpc/
```

#### d) Define custom url

```sh
export MVS_RPC_URL=http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT
```

### Set Private Key Environment (optional)

Required if you plan to deploy contracts or sign transactions.

```sh
# set environment variable 
export MVS_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```
